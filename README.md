This is an introduction to API's class which I was doing a recap on. 

In building this simple concept, we practiced the use of the POST method with the Fetch API while setting the paybload of our request, the Body, to structure the posted object to the mock up server.

We used the request header to define the data type for the server to be able to interpret our data. We then returned this value and re-rendered it to the DOM as a new post to our concept blog as seen below.
